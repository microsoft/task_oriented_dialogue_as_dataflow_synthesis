There are two datasets:

- **SMCalFlow 2.0:** This is an updated version of the dataset released with the [**Task-Oriented Dialogue as Dataflow Synthesis** (TACL 2020)](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/tacl_a_00333) paper, which removed a very small number of incorrectly annotated examples, dropped argument names for positional arguments (so that the programs are shorter), and added inferred type arguments for type-parameterized functions that were missing in the original SMCalFlow data.
- **TreeDST:** This is a modified version of the [TreeDST dataset]([apple/ml-tree-dst (github.com)](https://github.com/apple/ml-tree-dst)) which has been converted to the Lispress representation used for SMCalFlow 2.0, and transformed to make use of the `refer` and `revise` meta-computation operators. The transformation is described in the appendix of the paper referenced above.

Furthermore, compared to the original release of the SMCalFlow dataset, these two datasets also provide programs which have been fully annotated with types for all nodes, after running a Hindley-Milner based type inference algorithm (also described in the aforementioned paper). These programs are included in the new `fully_typed_lispress` field in the JSON objects that correspond to dialogue turns. It is not recommended to use these programs directly with simple Seq2Seq baselines because they are very verbose and the information they additional information they contain can be derived directly from the `lispress` programs by running type inference. That is also why the `lispress` programs are the ones used by the official evaluation script in SMCalFlow leaderboard.
